# Simple28-Budget-Club-Racer
ALZA-Racing Simple28 is a Free to 3D print low-cost model concept, where almost all components of the car can be 3D-printed by the user using PLA filament.

The car is designed around low speed 030 micro motor, which should not exceed 14,000 RPM at the rated 5V, or 20,000 RPM at 7.4V.

Its simple design and low weight allow for good agility of the model through corners and during acceleration.

The model is not intended for professional racing or aggressive driving, but for enjoying with friends and requiring minimal maintenance with little investment. "Smooth is Fast."
